# Greed
This is a social experiment written in JavaScript, defining personality types and observing natural behaviours depending on these types for a given number of actors, the aim of the project is to observe different types of personas interacting in a social setting. Play with the parameters in the final for loop to effect outcome of the scenarios. Every person starts with 5 coins and give or not give each other a coin in their consecutive turns depending on their personality. Giving type always gives the coin, neutral mirrors the person in front of them and greedy always keeps the coin for themselves.
